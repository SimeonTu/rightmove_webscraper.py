# Project Changes Summary

## Overview
The original `rightmove_webscraper` package (v1.1.2) was outdated and incompatible with the current Rightmove website. This project has been completely modernized and enhanced with new features.

---

## Major Changes from Original Project

### 1. **Complete Website Compatibility Overhaul**
- **Original**: Used XPath-based HTML parsing to scrape property data
- **Updated**: Extracts data from embedded JSON in Next.js `__NEXT_DATA__` script tags
- **Why**: Rightmove redesigned their website using Next.js framework, rendering the old XPath selectors obsolete
- **Result**: Scraper now works with the current 2025 Rightmove website

### 2. **Organized Output System with Timestamped Folders**
- **Original**: Saved files directly to project root with generic names
- **Updated**: Creates structured output with timestamped folders
  ```
  results/
  └── scrape_2025-Oct-15_at_13h45m/
      ├── properties.csv
      └── statistics.txt
  ```
- **Why**: Enables tracking multiple scrapes over time and easy comparison
- **Result**: Each scrape run is preserved in its own clearly dated folder

### 3. **Comprehensive Full Statistics Report**
- **Original**: Only displayed limited console output (top 10-15 results)
- **Updated**: Generates complete `statistics.txt` file with ALL data:
  - All postcodes (not limited to top 15)
  - All estate agents (161+ agents with full breakdowns)
  - All property types
  - Price quartiles and standard deviations
  - Bathroom counts
  - Listing status analysis
  - Search criteria documentation
- **Why**: Provides complete analysis without artificial limits
- **Result**: Full statistical reports suitable for detailed market analysis

### 4. **Enhanced Data Fields**
- **Original**: Basic fields (price, type, address, bedrooms, postcode, agent)
- **Updated**: Extended data including:
  - `bathrooms` - Number of bathrooms
  - `added_or_reduced` - "Added today", "Reduced yesterday", etc.
  - `first_visible_date` - When listing first appeared
  - `let_type` - Rental type information
  - `property_url` - Direct link to property page
  - `contact_url` - Agent contact form link
  - `branch_id` - Estate agent branch identifier
  - `summary` - Full property description
- **Why**: Provides richer data for analysis and filtering
- **Result**: More comprehensive property information per listing

### 5. **Improved Timestamp Readability**
- **Original**: N/A (no timestamped folders)
- **Updated**: Human-readable format `2025-Oct-15_at_13h45m`
- **Why**: Easier to identify and navigate scrape sessions
- **Result**: Clear, sortable folder names that are immediately understandable

### 6. **Better Error Handling and Progress Tracking**
- **Original**: Limited error feedback
- **Updated**:
  - Real-time page-by-page progress indicators (✓ symbols)
  - Detailed error messages with context
  - Graceful handling of rate limits and missing data
  - Duplicate detection and removal reporting
- **Why**: Provides transparency and helps diagnose issues
- **Result**: Users can monitor scraping progress and troubleshoot problems

### 7. **Updated Search Parameters**
- **Original**: User-provided URL (example used max price only)
- **Updated**: Now includes minimum price filter (`minPrice=600`)
- **New Search**: £600 - £1,500 pcm (vs previously no minimum)
- **Why**: More targeted search results within desired price range
- **Result**: Filters out extremely low-priced parking spaces and storage units

### 8. **Modern Python Practices**
- **Original**: Python 3.6+ compatible, older coding patterns
- **Updated**:
  - Type hints throughout (`Tuple[pd.DataFrame, dict]`, `Optional[int]`)
  - Pathlib for file operations (instead of string paths)
  - Context managers for file writing
  - Formatted string literals (f-strings)
- **Why**: Better code quality, IDE support, and maintainability
- **Result**: More robust and professional codebase

### 9. **Multi-Page Scraping with Rate Limiting**
- **Original**: Scraped all pages with no configurable delay
- **Updated**:
  - Configurable delay between requests (default 1.5s)
  - Optional max page limit for testing
  - Polite scraping with progress feedback
- **Why**: Reduces chance of being rate-limited by Rightmove
- **Result**: More reliable scraping with adjustable politeness

### 10. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- **Original**: Basic README
- **Updated**:
  - `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed usage instructions and examples
  - `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This document
  - Inline code documentation and docstrings
  - Example scripts for testing
- **Why**: Helps users understand and customize the scraper
- **Result**: Self-service documentation for various use cases

## Files Added

### New Scripts
- `multi_page_scraper.py` - Main production scraper with full features
- `modern_scraper.py` - Single-page scraper for quick tests
- `test_new_output.py` - Test script for folder structure
- `debug_page.py` - Debugging tool for HTML structure
- `check_json_data.py` - Tool to inspect JSON data

### Documentation
- `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Complete usage guide
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Infrastructure
- `venv/` - Virtual environment with dependencies
- `results/` - Organized output folder structure

## Technical Implementation Details

### Original Architecture
```
User URL → HTTP Request → HTML Response → XPath Parsing → DataFrame → CSV
```

### New Architecture
```
User URL → HTTP Request → HTML Response → Regex Extract JSON →
Parse JSON → DataFrame → CSV + Statistics Report → Timestamped Folder
```

### Key Technical Improvements
1. **Data Extraction**: JSON parsing (faster, more reliable) vs XPath (brittle, deprecated)
2. **Error Recovery**: Try-catch blocks with informative messages
3. **Data Validation**: Duplicate detection, null handling, type conversion
4. **Output Management**: Organized folder structure with metadata
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive breakdowns with pandas aggregations

---

## Backwards Compatibility

**Breaking Changes:**
- Original `RightmoveData` class no longer works with current Rightmove website
- Output file locations have changed (now in `results/` folders)
- Some column names have changed or been added

**Migration Path:**
- Use `multi_page_scraper.py` instead of original `scraper.py`
- Update any scripts that reference hardcoded file paths
- Review new column names if filtering/analyzing data

## Performance Improvements

| Metric | Original | Updated | Improvement |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Website Compatibility | ✗ Broken | ✓ Working | 100% |
| Data Fields | 9 fields | 18 fields | +100% |
| Statistics Depth | Top 10-15 | Unlimited | Complete |
| Output Organization | Flat files | Timestamped folders | Organized |
| Error Handling | Basic | Comprehensive | Enhanced |
| Documentation | README only | Multi-file guides | Extensive |

## Summary

The updated scraper is a **complete rewrite** that:
- ✓ Works with the modern Rightmove website (2025)
- ✓ Provides organized, timestamped output folders
- ✓ Generates comprehensive statistical reports with all data
- ✓ Includes extended property information
- ✓ Uses modern Python best practices
- ✓ Has better error handling and user feedback
- ✓ Includes complete documentation

**Bottom Line**: This is not just an update—it's a full modernization that makes the scraper functional again while adding professional features for serious property market analysis.
