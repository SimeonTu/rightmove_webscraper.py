Hello Joana,

Thank you for the information. I have now set up proper safeguards to prevent future unexpected charges.

I have configured the following:

- **API Key Restrictions**: Restricted my API key to only Routes API and Geocoding API to prevent accidental use of other services
- **Billing Alerts**: Enabled billing alerts in Google Cloud Console to be notified when usage approaches thresholds
- **Quota Management**: Reviewed the quota settings for Routes API and Geocoding API. I understand the free tier limits (5,000-10,000 requests/month for Routes API depending on version, and 40,000/month for Geocoding API) and will monitor my usage to stay within these limits

I've also updated my scripts to:
- Implement local caching to avoid redundant API calls
- Add usage tracking and warnings before making batch API calls
- Process smaller batches of data at a time

These safeguards will help ensure I stay within the free tier limits and prevent any future unexpected charges.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if you can now proceed with reviewing my billing adjustment request.

Thank you for your patience.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
