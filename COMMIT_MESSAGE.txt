Modernize scraper for 2025 Rightmove website with organized output and comprehensive statistics

## Summary
Complete rewrite of the Rightmove web scraper to work with the current Next.js-based website (2025). The original XPath-based scraper was broken due to Rightmove's website redesign. This version extracts data from embedded JSON, adds organized timestamped output folders, and generates comprehensive statistical reports with no artificial limits.

## Major Changes

### Core Functionality
- **Fixed website compatibility**: Replaced XPath HTML parsing with JSON extraction from Next.js `__NEXT_DATA__` tags
- **Multi-page scraping**: Added automatic pagination with configurable delays (default 1.5s) and progress tracking
- **Extended data fields**: Increased from 9 to 18 property fields including bathrooms, listing status, descriptions, and direct URLs

### Output Organization
- **Timestamped folders**: Each scrape creates `results/scrape_2025-Oct-15_at_13h45m/` with human-readable dates
- **Comprehensive statistics**: Generated `statistics.txt` includes ALL postcodes, ALL estate agents (161+), and complete breakdowns with no top-N limits
- **Structured exports**: Both CSV and TXT files organized in dated folders for easy comparison over time

### Search Configuration
- **Price filtering**: Added `minPrice=600` to filter out parking spaces and storage units
- **Updated search**: South East London, £600-£1,500 pcm, max 2 bedrooms
- **Documented criteria**: Search parameters embedded in statistics reports for reference

### Code Quality
- **Modern Python practices**: Type hints, Pathlib, context managers, f-strings
- **Error handling**: Graceful failures with detailed error messages and duplicate detection
- **Progress feedback**: Real-time page-by-page progress with ✓ symbols
- **Rate limiting**: Polite scraping with configurable delays to avoid blocking

## New Files Added

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Before**: `URL → HTTP → HTML → XPath → DataFrame → CSV`
- **After**: `URL → HTTP → HTML → JSON Extraction → DataFrame → CSV + Stats → Timestamped Folder`

### Data Improvements
- Price quartiles and standard deviations
- Complete postcode analysis (36 unique areas)
- Full estate agent breakdown (161+ agents tracked)
- Bathroom counts and listing status tracking
- Property descriptions and contact URLs

### Performance & Reliability
- Duplicate detection and removal (removed 9 duplicates in test run)

- Network error recovery

## Testing
- ✅ Successfully scraped 285 properties across 12 pages
- ✅ Generated complete statistics with all breakdowns
- ✅ Timestamped folders working correctly
- ✅ CSV exports with 18 columns validated
- ✅ Rate limiting preventing blocks

## Breaking Changes
- Original `RightmoveData` class from `rightmove_webscraper/scraper.py` no longer functional
- Output location changed from project root to `results/` folders
- Some column names changed/added (see documentation)

## Migration Guide
1. Use `multi_page_scraper.py` instead of original scraper
2. Update any scripts referencing file paths to use `results/` folder
3. Review new column names in CSV output
4. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`

## Dependencies
- Existing requirements maintained (lxml, numpy, pandas, requests)
- Virtual environment already configured
- Python 3.6+ compatible (tested on 3.13.7)
