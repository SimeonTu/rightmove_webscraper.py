## What Changed from Original

The original `rightmove_webscraper` (v1.1.2) was completely broken:
- ❌ Used XPath parsing (doesn't work with new site)
- ❌ No organized output
- ❌ Limited statistics (top 10-15 only)
- ❌ Basic data fields only

New version:
- ✅ JSON extraction from Next.js (works with 2025 site)
- ✅ Timestamped output folders
- ✅ Complete statistics (ALL postcodes, ALL agents)
- ✅ 18 extended data fields
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Modern Python practices
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Important Notes

1. **Virtual Environment**: Always activate `venv` before running
2. **Rate Limits**: Default 1.5s delay - increase if you get errors
3. **Legal**: For personal/educational use only per Rightmove's ToS
4. **Results Folder**: Created automatically, contains all scrape runs

## Next Steps

1. Run `python multi_page_scraper.py` to scrape all properties
2. Check `results/scrape_[timestamp]/` for output files
3. View `statistics.txt` for complete analysis
4. Open `properties.csv` in Excel/pandas for custom analysis
